Flask is a web application framework written in Python. Armin Ronacher, who leads an international group of Python enthusiasts named Pocco, develops it. Flask is based on Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. Both are Pocco projects
It’s a microframework, but that doesn’t mean your whole app should be inside one single Python file. You can and should use many files for larger programs, to handle complexity.

Micro means that the Flask framework is simple but extensible. You may all the decisions: which database to use, do you want an ORM etc, Flask doesn’t decide for you.

Flask is one of the most popular web frameworks, meaning it’s up-to-date and modern. You can easily extend it’s functionality. You can scale it up for complex applications.
